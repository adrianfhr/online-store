# Online Store

This is a simple backend online store project that I created with golang. It uses a simple in-memory database to store the products and orders. The project is a simple REST API that allows you to create, read, update, and delete products and orders.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you need to have golang installed on your machine. You can download and install golang from the [official golang website](https://golang.org/).
